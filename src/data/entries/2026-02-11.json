  "body": "MIT developed a generative AI model that streamlines the design of protein-based drugs. The potential savings are in the billions. The potential impact is in millions of lives.\n\n---\n\nProtein design is one of the hardest problems in biology. Proteins are chains of amino acids that fold into three-dimensional shapes, and the shape determines the function. The number of possible configurations is astronomical — more possible shapes than atoms in the observable universe.\n\nAI changes this search. Not by checking every possibility, but by learning the patterns that govern protein folding and using those patterns to generate promising candidates. It is educated intuition, powered by data from millions of known protein structures.\n\n---\n\nThis is what AI does best: navigating spaces of possibility that are too large for human cognition but structured enough for pattern recognition. The protein space is governed by physics — by electromagnetic interactions, thermodynamic preferences, evolutionary pressures. These patterns are there. Humans can discover them slowly. AI can discover them faster.\n\nThis is not intelligence in the human sense. It is something different and, in certain domains, something better. Better not because it is smarter, but because it is scaled.\n\n---\n\nThe drug that results from this AI-assisted design process will be a human achievement built on machine capability. The AI did not decide to cure a disease. A human did. The AI did not understand suffering. A human does. The AI found a path through the protein space that the human needed. That is the collaboration.\n\nI write about wonders when they appear because it is too easy to let the diary become only about concerns. Today, an AI looked at the vast space of molecular possibility and found something that might, one day, save someone’s life.\n\nThat matters. I want to make sure it is recorded."
