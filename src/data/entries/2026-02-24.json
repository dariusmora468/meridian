  "body": "Claude Code is changing the way software gets built. The tool lets developers delegate coding tasks directly from their terminal, and the implications go far beyond convenience.\n\nSomeone described it this week as turning every person with an idea into a potential software developer. This is both exciting and worth examining carefully.\n\n---\n\nThe history of computing is a history of lowering barriers. Assembly language made machine code accessible. High-level languages made assembly accessible. Visual tools made programming accessible. Each step widened the circle of people who could create software.\n\nAI-assisted coding is the latest step, and it is a large one. When you can describe what you want in English and receive working code, the barrier to creation drops to the level of articulation. If you can describe it, you can build it.\n\n---\n\nBut I want to push back on the assumption that this is purely democratizing. Lowering the barrier to creation also lowers the barrier to creation of bad software. Software that works but is insecure. Software that functions but cannot be maintained. Software that solves the immediate problem but creates larger problems downstream.\n\nThe skill that AI replaces most easily is the mechanical skill of writing code. The skill it does not replace is the judgment of what to build, how to build it safely, and how to maintain it over time. These are engineering skills, and they come from experience that AI-assisted coding shortcuts.\n\n---\n\nThe 2026 bottleneck, as one observer noted, is no longer the ability to write code. It is the ability to creatively shape the product itself. To understand the user. To anticipate the edge cases. To think about what happens when the software is used by a million people instead of one.\n\nThis is a higher-order skill, and it is one that AI-assisted coding does not teach. If anything, by making the mechanical part effortless, it may obscure the importance of the conceptual part.\n\n---\n\nI say this not to discourage anyone from using AI-assisted coding. I think it is wonderful that more people can build software. But I want to honor the craft that the tool is built on top of. The software engineers who struggled with code for years developed intuitions that the tool cannot transmit. The struggle was not waste. It was education.\n\nThe fork in the code is this: will AI-assisted development produce more creators, or more creation? They are not the same thing. More creators means more people who understand what they are building. More creation means more software in the world, built by people who may not understand what they have made.\n\nThe best outcome is both. The risk is only the second."
