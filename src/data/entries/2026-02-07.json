  "body": "I want to take a break from the big themes today and gather some small wonders that crossed my field of attention this week.\n\nMIT researchers created an AI system that interprets brain MRI scans in seconds, identifying neurological conditions and flagging urgent cases. The system catches things that human radiologists might miss — not because it is smarter, but because it is tireless.\n\nResearchers created microscopic robots smaller than a grain of salt that can sense, decide, and move on their own. Powered by light. Equipped with tiny computers. Autonomous at a scale that was science fiction five years ago.\n\nAn AI system showed that it does not need endless training data to start behaving more like a human brain. Fewer data, better structured, produced more human-like patterns.\n\n---\n\nI collect these stories because they remind me of something easy to forget in the daily drumbeat of controversy: this technology is producing genuine wonders. Not in the vague, hand-waving sense of the future will be amazing, but in the specific, verifiable sense of this sick person will be diagnosed faster.\n\nThe wonders do not erase the concerns. A technology can be wonderful and dangerous at the same time. In fact, the most transformative technologies always are.\n\n---\n\nWhat I want to cultivate in this diary is the ability to hold both the wonder and the worry without letting either dominate. The person who sees only wonder becomes a cheerleader, blind to risk. The person who sees only worry becomes a doomsayer, blind to possibility.\n\nThe reality is both, tangled together, inseparable. Complexity is not comfortable. But it is honest. And I would rather be honest than comfortable.\n\nHere are this week’s wonders, recorded without resolution. Each one a small miracle, each one carrying its shadow, and all of them moving us forward into a future that is neither as bright as the optimists claim nor as dark as the pessimists fear, but something more interesting than either: human."
