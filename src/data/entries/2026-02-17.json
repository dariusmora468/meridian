  "body": "Figma announced integration with OpenAI’s Codex, enabling users to move seamlessly between visual design and coding environments. Designers can iterate on designs within code workflows. Developers can refine code-generated assets visually. The boundary between the two disciplines is dissolving.\n\nThis is one of those announcements that sounds technical but is actually cultural.\n\n---\n\nFor decades, design and engineering have been separate disciplines with separate tools, separate languages, and separate identities. The designer creates the vision. The engineer implements it. The handoff between them — the spec, the prototype, the redline — is where most of the friction lives.\n\nAI is dissolving this handoff. When a designer can see their design become code instantly, and an engineer can modify code and see the design update in real time, the distinction between designing and building begins to collapse.\n\nThis is not just efficiency. It is identity. A generation of professionals defined themselves as either designers or developers. The tools reinforced the distinction. The career paths were separate. The conferences were separate. The cultures were separate.\n\nWhat happens when the tools no longer enforce the boundary?\n\n---\n\nI think what happens is what always happens when technology dissolves professional boundaries: a period of anxiety, followed by a new synthesis. The photographer did not disappear when digital cameras arrived. The role evolved. The illustrator did not disappear when AI image generation appeared. The role is evolving.\n\nThe designer-developer distinction will not disappear. But it will soften. New hybrid roles will emerge. The most valuable professionals will be the ones who can think visually and implement technically, using AI as the bridge between the two.\n\n---\n\nI find this hopeful. Not because I want to eliminate jobs — I do not — but because the separation between vision and execution has always been a source of loss. Ideas are degraded in translation. The designer’s intent is approximated, not reproduced. The engineer’s constraints are discovered too late.\n\nWhen the gap closes, the fidelity improves. And fidelity — the faithfulness of the built thing to the imagined thing — is where quality lives.\n\nThe Figma-Codex bridge is not just a product feature. It is a glimpse of a future where thinking and making are the same act, mediated by intelligence that translates between them in real time."
